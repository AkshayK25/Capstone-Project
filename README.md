# ECO-FRIENDLY CITY LOCATOR

In this era of fast-growing community and Industries upcoming future of earth doesn’t seems so bright. Due
to huge increment in population density and pollution (water, air, land, noise) places are becoming less
habitable and dangerous for humans. The degrading air quality index, high ppm of water and high population
density making it more worsen for humans. Natural resources are being depilated at very high rate.

Considering all these factors we came with a unique idea of a system which can show people about all the
affecting factors to the particular city and rank the city according to its condition with the respect of its
neighbour cities. Which will help user to decide which city will be better to live in.
To get the analytics and to figure out the eco-friendliest city (state) within India based on 5 major factors
affecting its depletion. On the basis of that our website reframe itself considering which zone it belongs to, as
a result it will show the use all the graphical analytics using all the permutations & combinations of data
fetched from backend through API’s and will give you a brief description about it in different facts and figures
in textual context as well.

At last, with the help of effective machine learning algorithm prediction model it will give user the most
suitable standings and fixtures of users entered state measuring several factors as conclusive results. Users
will get a ranking of cities including his/her chosen option with all the labels and also have the options of
optimizations amongst all these 5 factors.

# Research Gaps :

1) The need of this system comes into presence because there are models and techniques available which
only shows the current figures and data only but this system will analyze the past data with the help of
supervised machine learning algorithms and will predict the future data.

2) There are various models over the internet which only show figures and data only but our system will
show the data in graphical representation which makes it lot easier to understand.

3) Everything is today available on internet but it is distributed over the entire web and user have to
visit different sites to get the information while this system not only show all the information at a
single page but also merge them in a meaningful way to produce a result using various machine
learning algorithms.

4) This system is equipped with a ranking feature which ranks the cities in their particular zones
according to the air quality, population density and climate factors, which is missing in the most of
the systems available.

5) The present systems are not so much interactive but our system provides user the flexibility of
choosing different factors to evaluate the desired result. In the final outcome user will be suggested
the best eco-friendly city.

# Novelty points :
1) There are various models and websites available on the internet which tell about current condition of
air quality index of a current location but in our project, we will be analyzing the past data and will
be forecasting about its upcoming scenario.

2) Population is also a major factor to look into we will be also doing analysis on population increment
in a particular zone and predict the gradient of the increment.

3) Our model is compatible of comparison between different cities and ranking them according to their
air quality and population density.

4) User will also get suggestion about choosing the best city according to his chosen factors.
5) Not only above features but user will also get to know the situation of his current residing area. The
model will fetch the user’s location and will show the air quality and weather conditions of his area.

# Technology and Tools Used :

1) Python
Python will be used for fetching of data and cleaning and analyzing purposes. Libraries like pandas,
matplotlib and seaborn will be used for visualization of data.

2) MS Excel
Data of population density and pollution which are causing harm to the environment will be stored
in MS excel file and later fetched to python for further use. Cleaning of data will be also done in
excel.

3) HTML
Hypertext markup language will be used for the frontend to create the website. In Markup language
tags are used to define the page layout and elements within the page. Its main focus is on how to
display information on web pages

4) CSS
Cascading Style Sheets will be used for the UI and a graphical user interface and to make a
presentational look for the document including layout, fonts etc. and also to make our site look better
at all platforms when it works as responsive and PWA.

5) Java script
System will use JS to create a dynamic and interactive experience for the user. Most of the functions
and applications that make the Internet indispensable to modern life are coded in some form of
JavaScript.

6) Node Js
For any website to be live on the web it needs some tech required in the backend so here model will
use Node JS for the functionality on the server side.

7) Bootstrap
Bootstrap is the most popular CSS framework for developing responsive websites e.g. no matter the
screen size the website adjusts itself accordingly with better layout, fonts and designs.

8) Git
Git is one of the popular platforms for code hosting. It also helps in version controlling and
collaborating with multiple developers in working on the same project at real time.

9) RESTful API
Representational state transfer API is an architectural style for an application program interface that
uses HTTP requests to retrieve and use data and which defines the structure of the website.

10) Heroku
Heroku is a cloud platform to host projects, it will be used to demonstrate our project on its server
with their subdomain. And easy to configure the server on Heroku as at some level it deploys
project easily by connecting GitHub repos and basic commands.

11) Tableau
Tableau will be used to clean the dataset and remove the NULL values in the excel sheet and
visualize the data and filter it according to the research. Graphical representation and forecasting
will be done using tableau itself.
Module Description1) Landing page –
On the landing page user will get to know about weather, air quality and population density of his
current residing city. Further user will be having four zones to choose and find a city which will
best suit his required demands. Categorization of cities in zones (north, south, east, west) will
make easier for user to choose.

2) Air Quality analysis module –
This module will analyze the past air quality indexes of different cities and predict the quality of
air in upcoming years. It will use a supervised machine learning model for prediction.

3) Population density analysis moduleAs of air quality analysis we will be also analyzing the population density data of past few years
and will predict the increase in population for upcoming years. It will be also using a supervised
machine learning model.

4) Climate and Global warming analysis module –
This module will analyze the changing climate and weather conditions of the area based on past
data.

5) Rank Prediction Module –
This module will compare the all the cities in a particular zone and rank them according to their
air quality, population density and climate change factor. It will also suggest user the best ecofriendly out of all the respective cities.


# Project Outcome :

1) Air quality index prediction of a particular city in India.
2) Population density prediction for upcoming years and Graphical representation of climate and
weather changes.
3) Ranking the cities in their particular zones according to different-different factors (Air quality,
population density).
4) Suggesting the best Eco-friendly city in a particular zone
